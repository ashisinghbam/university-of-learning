          <h2>Welcome to Our University</h2>
        <p>
          The University of Cambridge is a collegiate research university in
          Cambridge, United Kingdom. Founded in 1209[9] and granted a royal
          charter by Henry III in 1231, Cambridge is the second-oldest
          university in the English-speaking world and the world's fourth-oldest
          surviving university.[10] The university grew out of an association of
          scholars who left the University of Oxford after a dispute with the
          townspeople.[11] The two English ancient universities share many
          common features and are often jointly referred to as Oxbridge.

          Cambridge is formed from a variety of institutions which include 31
          semi-autonomous constituent colleges and over 150 academic
          departments, faculties and other institutions organised into six
          schools. All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the
          university, each controlling its own membership and with its own
          internal structure and activities. All students are members of a
          college. Cambridge does not have a main campus, and its colleges and
          central facilities are scattered throughout the city. Undergraduate
          teaching at Cambridge consists of lectures, weekly small-group
          supervisions in the colleges, seminars, laboratory work and
          occasionally further supervisions provided by the central university
          faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided
          predominantly centrally.
